        <h2>Human-Machine Reconfigurations</h2>
        <h3>Lucy Suchman</h3>

        <p>This 2007 book considers how agencies are currently figured at the human-machine interface, and how they might be imaginatively and materially reconfigured.
            The question shifts from debates over the status of human-like machines, to that of how humans and machines are enacted as similar or different in practice,
            and with what theoretical, practical and political consequences. Drawing on scholarship across the social sciences, humanities and computing, the author argues
            for research aimed at tracing the differences within specific sociomaterial arrangements without resorting to essentialist divides. This requires expanding
            our unit of analysis, while recognizing the inevitable cuts or boundaries through which technological systems are constituted.</p>

        <h2>New Dark Age</h2>
        <h3>James Bridle</h3>
        <blockquote>“Reading a book, listening to music, researching and learning: these and many other activities are increasingly governed
            by algorithmic logics and policed by opaque and hidden computational processes”
        </blockquote>

        <p>In his brilliant work, leading artist and writer James Bridle surveys the history of art, technology, and information systems, and reveals
            the dark clouds that gather over our dreams of the digital sublime.
